[===== NECESSARY =====]
- Function calls
     - User-defined operator overloading
- Implement other lvalue builtin operators
- Handle assignment operator
    - rvalues
- Casts: do not allow every cast, e.g., bool -> T

[===== DESIRED =====]
- Implement array types
- Implement structs
- Implement strings
- Implement `import` statement, i.e., multiple files

[===== MAYBE =====]
- Memory spill functionality
