This file contains some primary objectives which need to be met.

[===== NECESSARY =====]
- Expressions
    - Method to evict registers after use (to avoid memory spill leading to assertion error)
- Function calls
     - User-defined operator overloading
- Implement other lvalue builtin operators
- Handle assignment operator
    - rvalues

[===== DESIRED =====]
- Expose [u]int<n> names for types
- Implement array types
- Implement structs
- Implement strings
- Implement `import` statement, i.e., multiple files

[===== MAYBE =====]
- Memory spill functionality
