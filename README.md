# Uni Project

As stated in the title, this repository holds the source code for my third year University project.
Just like the top-level directory names, this project can be split into three primary components:

- **Processor**: this project defines a custom RISC-based ISA and implements a processor emulator.
- **Assembler**: this project implements a relatively simple assembler.
- **High-level Language**: this project defines a custom programming language and implements a compiler, outputting an assembly source.

For more details, please see the `docs` directory.
